How to run this assignment:
/*

make

./mcc mic1_nand_rshift.mc > p.dat

./masm_nr -o < a4_(test files|rshift|mult|div)_test.asm > as_div_test.obj

./mic1 p.dat as_(test files|rshift|mult|div)_test.obj 0 2048

*/
I believe that my assignment is between 75 to 100%  of success. At first, I didn't know how to start this assigment, it was kind of hard and still is.I feel like this assigment, it's by far the hardest thing I've done in class. However, I used Proferssor Bill Moloney's website http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs305/assignment_4_help_dir/ and I watched the lecture too. Rshift was giving and we had to implement mult and div. also, I have the mic1symasm_nand_rshift.c and mic1symasm_nand_rshift.ll are working. Rshift,mult, and div each have their own output file. 
update:
I need help understanding what I did. On Tuesday November 7, I made some changes in .mc that changed total cycles if you can compare; ./mic1 p.dat as_(test files|rshift|mult|div)_test.obj 0 2048 and ./mic1 pad.dat as_(test files|rshift|mult|div)_test.obj 0 2048
